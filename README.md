## 2. Project Description

This project is a Java-based console application developed for the CIT300 Data Structures and Algorithms module.

The main purpose of this system is to demonstrate the practical use of different data structures, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and algorithmic complexity.

The application provides a menu-based system where users can perform operations on:

* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Searching Algorithms
* Graph
* BFS Traversal
* DFS Traversal
* Performance and Complexity

The system also provides input validation and handles invalid operations such as attempting to remove an item from an empty stack or queue.
